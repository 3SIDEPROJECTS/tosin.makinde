            <p>Let me tell you about the day I fell in love.</p>
            <p>November 16, 1994. Nigeria vs England. I attended my first live match at THE original Wembley Stadium. The one with the twin towers. Yeah, THAT Wembley. I was instantly hooked.</p>
            <p>Football has been in my life for so long, I’ve played (well), coached (better than I played), refereed (there are no good refs) and now work as a storyteller. My professional career started in fashion, detoured into advertising & marketing, public relations and everything in between. All of these experiences are part of what made me who I am and have provided me with an arsenal of knowledge that enables me to entertain, strategize and inform in equal measures.</p>
            <p>I have learned the art of seeing a problem and creating a solution and in my case, that led to me creating my own football brand, The Shirtless Plantain Show.</p>
            <p>I do a multitude of things: social media, host/on air personality, podcaster, but overall, I’m a habitual line stepper that paints stories with a distinct and slightly irreverent aura.</p>
            <p>My name is Tosin Makinde, Nigerian born and London raised before moving to Baltimore in 2001. My multicultural background affords me a variety of lenses with which I’m able to understand the world and its inflections upon my experiences in sports. These unique perspectives provide me with enhanced storytelling techniques which add new colors to the world we share.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working, I’m watching sports, staying active at the gym, listening to podcasts, and experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>Past work and current clients include: Adidas, Audi, Burberry, CBS Sports, Complex, Emirates, Ogilvy, Nike and Spotify.</p>
