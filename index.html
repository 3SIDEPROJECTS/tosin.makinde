            <p>It was the day I first fell in love.</p>
            <p>Nigeria versus England, November 16, 1994 at THE original Wembley Stadium. The one with the twin towers. Yeah, THAT Wembley. I would never be the same.</p>
            <p>Football has been in my life for so long, I’ve played (well), coached (better than I played), refereed (there are no good refs) and now work as a storyteller. My professional career started in fashion, detoured into advertising & marketing, public relations and everything in between. These experiences made me a powerhouse in the art of digital storytelling; able to entertain, strategize, and inform in equal measures.</p>
            <p>I saw a void in the industry and filled it, creating my own digital platform dedicated to football, The Shirtless Plantain Show.</p>
            <p>Above all, I’m a habitual line stepper, pushing boundaries, and telling stories with a distinct perspective.</p>
            <p>My name is Tosin Makinde, born and raised in London to Nigerian parents before coming of age in Baltimore in 2001. I experience the world through many lenses and my ability to draw on the varied elements of my background provide me with unique storytelling techniques; adding strokes of new colors to the world’s tapestry we share.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working, I’m watching sports, staying active at the gym, listening to podcasts, and experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>Past work and current clients include: Adidas, Audi, Burberry, CBS Sports, Complex, Emirates, LG Mobile, Ogilvy, Nike and Spotify.</p>
